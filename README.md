# Multidrug Resistance

For this analysis, I used the New York City DOHMH Tuberculosis Surveillance: Data from the Tuberculosis Control Annual Summary.
I decided on analyzing this data because drug resistance is a prevalent issue in the public health sphere, this data was interesting because there was a spike in cases in the early 90s, which is when the DOHMH started recording these cases, and it has decrease and evened out steadily ever since.
According to the CDC there was an outbreak in a New York City hospital during 1991, which explains the spike in cases and why the city of New York increased their diligence on montioring multidrug resistant cases.
